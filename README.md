# WinDJ

#### An unobtrusive music player for Windows. Very useful for micspam in games too.

Note: this is the code behind the program. If you want to run it more easily, get the package [here](http://windj.eu).

How to get running:

1. First of all, you'll need VLC installed. Get it [here](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).

2. You'll need Python along with the python-vlc and pyHook modules.

3. dj.py is the main program, helper.py is the helper program (funnily enough).

4. You'll need the favicon and config file to be in the same folder.

For more detail, refer to the site [here](http://windj.eu) where you'll find the package that includes the in-depth readme.
